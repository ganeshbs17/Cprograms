1	[Develop a program to solve simple computational problems using arithmetic expressions and use of each operator leading to the simulation of a commercial calculator. (No built-in math function) ](https://github.com/ganeshbs17/Cprograms/blob/master/SimpleCalculator.c)

2	[Develop a program to compute the roots of a quadratic equation by accepting the coefficients. Print appropriate messages.](https://github.com/ganeshbs17/Cprograms/blob/master/QuadraticEqn.c)

3	[Develop a program to find the reverse of a positive integer and check for palindrome or not. Display appropriate messages.](https://github.com/ganeshbs17/Cprograms/blob/master/Palindrome.c)

4	[An electricity board charges the following rates for the use of electricity: for the first 200 units 80 paise per unit: for the next 100 units 90 paise per unit: beyond 300 units Rs 1 per unit. All users are charged a minimum of Rs. 100 as meter charge. If the total amount is more than Rs 400, then an additional surcharge of 15% of total amount is charged. Write a program to read the name of the user, number of units consumed and print out the charges.](https://github.com/ganeshbs17/Cprograms/blob/master/Electricitybill.c)

5	[Introduce 1D Array manipulation and implement a Binary search.](https://github.com/ganeshbs17/Cprograms/blob/master/BinarySearch.c)

6	[Implement using functions to check whether the given number is prime and display appropriate messages. (No built-in math function)](https://github.com/ganeshbs17/Cprograms/blob/master/prm.c)
